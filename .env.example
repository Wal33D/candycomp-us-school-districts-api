# Server Configuration
PORT=3712
NODE_ENV=development

# Security Configuration
# Set to true to enable security middleware (helmet, rate limiting, CORS)
# Set to false to disable for local-only deployments
# DEFAULT: false to maintain compatibility with existing deployments
ENABLE_SECURITY_MIDDLEWARE=false

# When security is enabled, these IPs/ranges bypass rate limiting
# Comma-separated list of IPs or CIDR ranges
BYPASS_IPS=127.0.0.1,::1,localhost

# Rate Limiting Configuration
RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS=60000    # 1 minute
RATE_LIMIT_MAX_REQUESTS=100   # 100 requests per window

# CORS Configuration
# Comma-separated list of allowed origins
# Use * to allow all origins (not recommended for production)
CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://localhost:3001

# Logging Configuration
LOG_LEVEL=info  # error, warn, info, debug

# Geometry Processing
# Tolerance for simplifying district boundaries (in decimal degrees)
# Lower values = more accurate but use more memory
# 0.001 = ~85-111 meters accuracy (recommended)
# 0.0005 = ~42-55 meters accuracy (high precision)
# 0.002 = ~170-222 meters accuracy (faster, less memory)
GEOMETRY_SIMPLIFICATION_TOLERANCE=0.001

# API Limits
# Maximum number of coordinates allowed in a single batch request
# Lower values reduce memory spikes during batch processing
# Range: 1-100, Default: 50
MAX_BATCH_SIZE=50

# Caching Configuration
# Number of district geometries to cache in memory
# Caches most frequently accessed districts (e.g., NYC, LA, Chicago)
# Set to 0 to disable caching completely
# Each cached geometry uses ~400KB-1MB of memory
# Range: 0-100, Default: 10
GEOMETRY_CACHE_SIZE=10
